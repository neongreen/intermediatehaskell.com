        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          We're writing a book about Haskell. It will be released at the
          beginning of 2018. The book will cover a mix of useful, advanced,
          or just interesting topics – from working with JSON and writing
          documentation to monad morphisms and libraries
          like <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vinyl"><code>vinyl</code></a>
          and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflection"><code>reflection</code></a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
          There is a long path from
          <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com">Learn You a Haskell</a>
          (or <a href="http://haskellbook.com">Haskell Programming from First
          Principles</a>) to becoming a professional Haskeller. Currently
          this path lies through reading lots of documentation, blog posts,
          and asking questions on IRC.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not very hard to change this – just take a couple of
          experienced Haskellers, have them write down everything they know
          about Haskell, and then publish the result somewhere. Well, we're
          those Haskellers.
        </p>
        <h2>Actually, who are you?</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://int-index.com">Vladislav Zavialov</a> and
          <a href="https://artyom.me">Artyom Kazak</a>. We don't have quite
          as much experience as the authors of
          venerable <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org">Real World
          Haskell</a>, but we make up for it by being crazy Russians.
        </p>
        <h2>Okay, I want the book!</h2>
        <p>
          Great! Just wait until 2018.
