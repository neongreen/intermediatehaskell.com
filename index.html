<h1>Intermediate Haskell<h1>
<h2>the book</h2>
<p>
  This is a book about intermediate Haskell â€“ parsing combinators, transformers and mtl,
  kinds and type algebra, GHC extensions, some advanced type-level concepts,
  libraries like <code>lens</code>, <code>pipes</code> and <code>reflection</code>,
  details of how data is represented in memory and how Haskell programs are evaluated,
  and so on. Basically, what professional Haskellers usually know, but people who have
  just finished LYAH usually don't.
